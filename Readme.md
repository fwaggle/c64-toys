fwaggle's c64 toys

A collection of c64 programs I knocked together messing around.

The ASM stuff is written for TMPx or you could paste it into TMP on a c64
emulator and it'd probably work okay. Most of it won't work on something
like DASM, and I don't feel like porting it.

The coding style is terrible - to keep it familiar with TMP I set my editor
to 12 or 16 character wide tabs, so not everything looks good in Github.

I may have nicked the basic header in include/boot.asm from somewhere,
don't know where.
